#Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused the loss of millions of human lives all over theworld and has lead to drastic changes in our everyday routines.Governments have relied on lockdowns, travel restrictions and other measures to pre-vent the spread of the virus.  To this day,  the COVID-19 outbreak still represents aserious threat to the health and economy of every country.  Therefore, it is importantto develop ways to understand and forecast the future trends of the pandemic to helpgovernments adopt proper control measures and educate the public to follow the guide-lines and avoid panic.After a critical analysis of the past literature, it is evident that Deep Learning modelsperformed reasonably well when used to predict infectious disease outbreaks, includingCOVID-19.In  this  study,  the  data  made  publicly  available  by  the  John  Hopkins  University  isused to build two different Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, namely VanillaLSTM and Bi-directional LSTM, which are used to forecast the number of cumulativeCOVID-19 cases for 30 days ahead in Italy, France, Spain, Germany and the UK.Both models produced comparable and promising results, which offers a valuable start-ing point to further develop the models by taking into considerations multiple variablesand taking advantage of mathematical epidemic models
